# August 5, 2025: Initiation of the mini-bot!
Planning Phase

Currently, I am working on a 3lb combat robot (vertical drisk spinner) named Dr. Piggy. I have learned a lot from that building experience, so I am glad to create another combat robot! This combat robot will strive to use the N20, 100 rpm motors. It will be around 150g-500g, depending on the configuration I run it with. The goal is to have it be a 4wd (or 2wd) with a compact/modular spinner or lifter weapon (via using servos).
The LiPo will be from 1s to 3s, depending on the proper voltage rating of the components (I'll figure it out along the way)

Inspiration (modular robot):

# August 13, 2025: More planning of the mini-bot!
Planning Phase

I’m narrowing down components for my 1 lb combat robot. For the drivetrain, I’ve settled on N20, 100 rpm motors—they’re compact and precise, perfect for a lightweight 4WD or 2WD setup. I’m considering small, high-traction wheels to maximize maneuverability without adding much weight. So far, I have two ideas in mind: one type of wheel will be a compliant TPU wheel, or I could do silicone wheels. I am able to incorporate 3D printing for both.
I drafted a quick mockup:

For the weapon, I’m planning a modular system. The goal is to swap between a small vertical spinner, a horizantal undercutter and a lifter quickly, so I'll probably use servos/brushless motors. I’m also looking at different materials for the weapon itself—thin aluminum/steel or reinforced 3D-printed parts—to keep the weight down while retaining strength.
Battery selection is key for hitting the 1 lb target. I’m leaning toward a 1s or 2s LiPo to balance power and weight, and I’ll test voltage under load to see what gives the best performance with the motors and servos.
Electronics will be minimal: a compact ESC, receiver, and wiring arranged to keep the center of gravity low. Right now, it’s all about choosing components that give maximum performance in a tiny, modular package.
I will be using FLYSKY receiver/transmitter, since it is the most-budget friendly (I already have a pair from an in-progress build, and they work great)
