## 10/3/2025 - 3D Modelling of Combat Robot

As you can see, I am closing in on 200 versions! That means, I edited, improved, and saved that exact file 200 times! This project has been ongoing for almost a year now! However, the log begins here: This is a rundown of what I had accomplished over the past year:

3lb combat robot
primarily 3D printed
using off-the-shelf drone components (motors, escs, etc.)
Drisk weapon, TPU hub w/ metal standoffs (m5)
Tangental drive w/ belt tensioners
3D printed TPU belts, belt tensioners (m5 leadscrew) necessary
majority of fasteners: m3 nuts and screws
modular wedge/fork mounting setup
swag can be engraved onto body
Ideas I'll probably do:

A fan on the motor that has a duct directed at the electronics
Here is what I accomplished today:

I started out with creating the parameters for the m3 hardware (nuts and screws). That way, I can adjust clearance for every instance of m3 hardware all at once, instead of manually changing, one-by-one. Then, I did a bit of "housekeeping", brushing up on some geometry:

I added spacers between my drisk weapon disks to increase space for the weapon belt tensioner
Increased strength (width) of weapon belt tensioner
I fixed the geometry for the drive belts (from 8mm wide to 6mm wide, reduced interference with the wheels)
I think I might need to rework the drivetrain - the bearing setup seems a bit unreliable. However, this may be difficult since I am using a tangental drive setup.
Fixed drivetrain compliant TPU wheel geometry
Split main body into two: I will need to create a connection system (future to-do)  

## 10/5/2025 - Internal Modelling

On this session, I worked more on polishing the robot. I have made a pretty significant decision to split the robot's general chassis into two parts. This way, I can have shorter 3D print times, meaning s smaller chance of print failure. To execute this, I added mounting points and connections. I also created a "fan-duct" channel. The goal is to mount a fan on the weapon motor, and while it spins the drisk weapon, the fan is also spun. The fan's air will be directed into the electronics, cooling it down.
And a quick sidenote: This project is in the middle of designing phase, and I do have a journal of past progress (I just read the FAQ on the "recently-just-begun" projects)
