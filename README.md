# Combat-Robot-Repository
## All about my Combat Robot journey!
### Introduction
Hey there, you can call me Aaron. I first started my journey in the world of making when I received a Prusa i3 MK3s+ years ago. After many, many headaches and troubleshooting, it is safe to say that I've come a long way since I first started making things. 
This repository is dedicated to my combat robot journey. Here I will post many helpful resources and files, so feel free to explore!

Images of my original work: 3lb combat robot, "Dr. Piggy", designed to be 3D printed!
