# Combat-Robot-Repository
## All about my Combat Robot journey!
### Introduction
Hey there, you can call me Aaron. I first started my journey in the world of making when I received a Prusa i3 MK3s+ years ago. After many, many headaches and troubleshooting, it is safe to say that I've come a long way since I first started making things. 
This repository is dedicated to my combat robot journey. Here I will post many helpful resources and files, so feel free to explore!

Images of my original work: 3lb combat robot, "Dr. Piggy", designed to be 3D printed!

This design has so many aspects and features, so I won't be able to go into all of them in detail! Here are the features that I am most proud of!
- Fully 3D Printed
This Combat Robot is meant to be easy to manufacture for EVERYONE. That means, I am using the least amount of different parts as possible (to make sourcing easier). This is reflected in the super short BOM. I use 3D printed TPU belts, and I got creative and included weapon belt tensioners!
- Vertical Spinner Drisk Weapon
Taking inspiration from Witch Doctor and Hypershock's weapon (they have already changed it), I am using a drisk weapon consisting of two disks sandwitching a drum. This is really easy to manufacture.
- Tangential Drivetrain
Since I'm only using off the shelf drone parts, a tangential drive train was used. This eliminates the need for a gearbox.

And that's about it! This project took me about 60 hours to complete! I will be releasing build instructions later as well!
